# grDesignDocument
A software design document for the Gaming Room application.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The Gaming Room is a client that is building the Draw It or Lose It game. It is a simple game that requires around 200 high definition pictures to be stored and displayed. User scores are tracked. There are teams within game instances and the game server and API are being developed with Maven and Dropwizard. It is not expected to have more than a few thousand users.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I provided plenty of relevant information, especially regarding memory and the differences between operating systems.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    This document forced me to distill information that is spread out over many websites and blog posts. It was a great exercise in sorting through fact and opinion and trying to distinguish between the two. It also forced me to learn more in depth about memory and storage so that I could better explain it.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    The executive summary could be improved. There could be more detail about the game and more information about how it should be developed.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The users operating system is important. The user interface must be adapted to different systems, including mobile. By including these considerations in the design, we can make sure all users get a quality display that does not have altered colors, invisible text, or pictures that do not fit the screen.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    In terms of design, my main approach was a UML diagram. Other sections of the document provided details that would be useful for guiding development, but the UML diagram is the heart of the design. In the future, I will likely make a UML diagram, which will be followed by a list of in-depth descriptions of each class or object. For more detail, this could be followed by questions such as "What environment should be used for development and why?", "How many/what kind of users are expected and why?", and "Is a cloud platform appropriate for this project and why?".
